I am the Saint John's Church ⛪️ Microsoft C# MVC5 EF6 full stack website developer.

Jan 2019 to present. 

I use Microsoft C Sharp for my chosen programming language. 
HTML 5 for the words, CSS4 for the layouts, 
Bootstrap 4 JavaScript for mobile phone, tablet and computer layouts, 
Alertify JavaScript for the pop ups, 
normal JavaScript for page load events, 
Font Awesome for icons in the menus and buttons, 
ASP.Net platform for the web pages, 
Jquery, JavaScript and CSS to make the mobile
menu button animate and also the drop down menus caret
rotate up and down once clicked on. 

DB Context class to get a list from the EF6 Microsoft SQL Database.
Model is where I hold my data: int string get set.
Controller to control the data from the Model to the View.
View to display my razor website page.
Entity Framework 6 to connect to the backend Microsoft SQL database.
Microsoft SQL Server MS 2019 backend database to store my data. 

As a PCC Member of the church, I do this free to help them.
